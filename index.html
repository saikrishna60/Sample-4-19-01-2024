<h2>Games for Competition</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>
<br/>
<p><em>Game One: Competition Between Two Companies Having Different<br/>
Material Resources (adapted from Kinoshita, 1996)</em></p>
<div style="width:550px;height:2px;background-color:black;"></div>
<p>Let’s consider the competition between two companies BURGER-A and<br/>
BURGER-B with respect to the number of sales points.</p>
<p>URGER-A (designated as A) has sales points while BURGER-B (desig-<br/>
nated as B) has sales points.</p>
<p>The game consists in taking or losing the sales points through competitions<br/>
simulated by tossing a coin. Thus,</p>
<ul>
<li>if HEADS occurs, A wins the first competition and takes possession of<br/>
one of B’s sales points and</li>
<li>f TAILS occurs, B takes possession of one of A’s sales points.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game ends when one of the companies loses all its sales points. For<br/>
instance, starting with the values = 2 and = 1 we have:</p>

<dl>
<ol type="a">
<dt><li><b> First competition:</b></li></dt>
<dd>If HEADS occurs, then A wins and stays with = 3 and = 0 and we have<br/>
a VICTORY FOR A, or<br/>
If TAILS occurs, then B wins with = 1 and = 2 and we will have the<br/>
second competition.</dd>
<dt><li type="b"><b>  Second competition:</b></li></dt>
<p><dd>HEADS: A wins with = 2 and = 1 and the game returns to the same<br/>
situation of the first competition, or<br/>
TAILS: B wins with = 0 and = 3 and we have a VICTORY FOR</dd></p>
</ol>
</dl>
</div>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

<p>282 Shimizu, de Carvalho and Laurindo</p>

<p>For every two competitions there exists a return to the first competition with<br/>
probability P (return to first competition) = ¼, forming an infinite sequence of<br/>
these two competitions.</p>
<h3>General Formulas for Game One</h3>
<p>For any value of e it is possible to show, using mathematical approximation<br/>
of infinite series, that</p>
<p>P(Victory for A) = / ( + ) and P(Victory for B) = b / ( + ).</p>
<p>Thus, the probability of victory is directly proportional to the value of its<br/>
available resource ( and ) if the chance of winning a competition is equal for<br/>
both companies.</p>
<p><em>Game Two: Competition Between two Companies with Different<br/>
Material Resources and Different Chances of Winning a Competition</em></p>
<div style="width:550px;height:2px;background-color:black;"> </div>

<p>Let’s consider that, in addition to establishing the value and for material<br/>
resources, we can also fix different chances of winning each competition, with<br/>
probability P(A wins one competition) = a and P(B wins one competition) =1-<br/>
a = b.</p>
<p>What are the chances of VICTORY for each company?<br/>
For instance,</p>
<p>
if = 1, = 1 , a = 2/3 and b= 1 – a = 1/3, then we could have<br/>
P(A wins) = 2/3 with = 2 and = 0, and have a VICTORY FOR A or<br/>
P(B wins) = 1/3 with = 0 and = 1, and have a VICTORY FOR B.
</p>

<h3>General Formulas for Game Two</h3>

<p>Using mathematical approximations based on the Gambler’s Ruin Problem of<br/>
Probability Theory ( Feller, W. – An Introduction to Probability Theory and its<br/>
Applications – 2nd Edition, Wiley, 1957, p. 314) it is possible to show that:</p>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

<p>The Role Of Simulation And Modern Business Games 283</p>
<p>P(Victory of A) = [ 1 – (b/a) ] / [ 1 – (b/a)+] and</br/>
P(Victory of B) = 1 – P(Victory of A)</p>
<p>and are the material resources of A and B and a and b are the probabilities<br/>
of victory for A and B in a single competition.</p>
<h2>A Market Share Simulation Based on Game Two</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"> </div>

<p>The effect of resources and , while the probability of victory in each<br/>
competition is a < b, can be analyzed using simulation. Simulations experiments<br/>
make it possible to observe some interesting results as shown in Table 11.2.<br/>
Each simulation experiment S was repeated 10 times and N is the number of<br/>
competitions held in each simulation run.</p>
<p><em>Comments</em></p>
<div style="width:550px;height:2px;background-color:black;"></div>
<p>It is possible to see that, in some cases, when the probability of victory in each<br/>
competition is a < b (not favorable for A), A can win the competition, starting<br/>
with greater amount of resources, > b. The difference between final resources<br/>
and depends on the total number N of competitions.</p></div>
<h2>A General Purpose Business Game</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:2px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>The basic form of a general purpose model of BUSINESS GAME [Naylor &<br/>
others (1971)] can be described as follows:</p>

<em>A business game with "1" companies competing for the market share of<br/>
"M" products in "K" market places.</em>
<p>For each period of simulation, the N companies fill out a DECISION FORM<br/>
containing, for instance:</p>
<p>DECISION 1: Unit sale price for each one of the M products;</p>
<p>DECISION 2: Total value invested in marketing;</p>

<div><h2>Continuous System Simulation</h2></div>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>A discrete-event simulation becomes complex when each equation involves<br/>
several variables of the problems simultaneously. One approach to simplify the<br/>
numerical calculations is to consider a set of simultaneous algebraic equations<br/>
or differential equations. Periods of time are advanced in uniform steps, and a<br/>
model of the system is represented in the form of difference or differential<br/>
equations. The variables of the model representing the attributes of the system<br/>
entities are controlled by continuous equations.</p>

<p>Simulation of a continuous system is largely used to control complex or<br/>
nonlinear engineering problems, or econometric models. Particular interest in</p>

<br><br/>
<br><br/>


<p>286 Shimizu, de Carvalho and Laurindo</p>

<p>using simulation of continuous systems relies in the fact that behavior of a system<br/>
can be controlled through the coupling between the input and output of the<br/>
system. The termfeedback is used to describe this phenomenon.</p>

<p><i>Industrial Dynamics and Business Dynamics</i> are models used to simulate<br/>
complex industrial and business systems. Industrial Dynamics is a term created<br/>
by Professor J. W. Forrester of MIT (Forrester, 1961), aiming to study the<br/>
characteristics and the performance of business corporations or one entire<br/>
industry. Business Dynamics is a term used by Professor J. D Sterman of MIT<br/>
(Sterman, 2000), extending the research on system dynamics for advanced<br/>
models of the business system. The illustrative example of Industrial Dynamics<br/>
Model of an Inventory Control System (Forrester, 1969), shown in the<br/>
following section, is based on the description and results presented by Gordon<br/>
(1978).</p>

<h2>Industrial Dynamics Model of an Inventory Control<br/>
System</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>A simple model of the inventory control system can be defined by the following<br/>
system of two ordinary first-order differential equations:</p>

<p>Y’ = U – V and X’ = V – S</p>
<p>V is the equation for the rate of delivery V = Y / T1, and U is the order rate<br/>
expressed by</p>

<p>U = S + K (I – X).</p>

<p>X is the current inventory level, Y is the outstanding level of orders placed with<br/>
the supplier, U is the rate of ordering from supplier, V is the rate of delivery from<br/>
supplier, and S is the rate of sales. In addition, three constants need to be<br/>
defined: I is the prefixed planned inventory level, T1 is the average delivery<br/>
time, and K is a constant called ordering constant.</p>

<p>The ordering policy introduces feedback and the value of K corresponds to the<br/>
amplification in the feedback loop. The value of K, along with the value of T1,<br/>
will determine if the system oscillates or not.</p>

<br><br/>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>

<p>The Role Of Simulation And Modern Business Games 287</p>

<p>This problem can be solved using a continuous system modeling language like<br/>
DYNAMO, or directly using a numerical method for a system of two first-order<br/>
differential equations, like Runge-Kutta method. The graphics shown in the<br/>
Figure 11.3 corresponds to the partial results presented in Gordon (1978)<br/>
using the IBM 360/CSMP (Continuous System Modeling Program).</p></div>
<p>Assume that a time is measured in units of days, and let the system be initialized<br/>
at time t = 0, with the following initial conditions:</p></div>
<p>I = X = 20 units; Y = 12 units; S = 4 items/day and T1 = 3 days.</p>
<p>Suppose the demand suddenly increases at time t = 4 to S = 6 items/day. The<br/>
oscillations of inventory level for some values of K (K = 1 or 0.5) are shown<br/>
in Figure 11.3.</p>

<p>Inventory level X (initial value X = 20 for t = 0).</p>

<h2>Case – The Struggle Against Uncertainty</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>For most of human history, people have had nothing more than instinct and<br/>
superstition to guide them in the face of uncertainty. The greatest of mathema-<br/>
ticians among the Egyptians, the Assyrians, the Greeks, the Romans and the<br/>
wise persons of the Middle Ages never considered whether it was worth it to<br/>
spend time measuring or managing risk, accepting uncertainty as a fatalism.<br/>
Even the gambling was practiced by rules that seemed arbitrary to anyone with<br/>
an elementary knowledge of probability.</p>
<p>Things began to change during the Renaissance and the Reformation period,<br/>
when there were changes in the way of thinking about the future. In 1654, the<br/>
mathematicians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat used mathematics to<br/>
analyze a simple game of chance —– and thus created the basis for the theory<br/>
of probability. The discoveries and developments of sampling techniques,<br/>
utility, regression, and correlation, provided a solid foundation to make a<br/>
rational assessment of risk management.</p>
<p>However, the advances of modern risk-management techniques should not<br/>
lead us to think that we totally dominate risk, or that such a feat might be<br/>
possible some day. It is important to remember that uncertainty is our friend,<br/>
not an adversary. For example, imagine a life without uncertainties, totally<br/>
ordered and predictable, that never deviates from an average pattern. Life<br/>
without uncertainty would be like a movie whose end we already know.<br/>

<p>I believe that the best way possible for us to live in this world is something close<br/>
to the one what we have, a world where life is like a game of bridge or poker,<br/>
and not like a game of roulette. It is worth making the effort to understand the<br/>
process of evaluating and controlling risk and uncertainty because human<br/>
beings learn from experience and from technology</p>
<p>(Excerpted from: The enlightening struggle against uncertainty, Peter L. Berstein,<br/>

<p>The Role Of Simulation And Modern Business Games 289</p>

<h2>Case – Project to Launch a New Product</h2>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>The pharmaceutical company MSS is developing a project to launch a food<br/>
supplement to be called PLQ in the market. This food supplement is added to<br/>
sugar to inhibit the development of dental caries, especially among adolescents.<br/>
Laboratory tests done up to the present have shown promising results and the<br/>
company is at the point of deciding between “going ahead with the project” or<br/>
simply abandoning it, absorbing the costs involved up to now. The company has<br/>
earlier experience in launching products and even though this is a new product<br/>
it was possible to construct a decision tree with multiple stages. This is a<br/>
problem of strategic nature for the company. The project needs to be<br/>
completed with the values of the parameters estimated based in past experi-<br/>
ence.</p>

<em>The Decision Tree</em>
<div style="width:550px;height:2px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>To proceed with the project for launching the product it was necessary to<br/>
consider the following decision stages:</p>
<p><b>Decision</b> 1. Proceed with other “laboratory tests” to verify the toxicity (two<br/>
possible outcomes “acceptable” and “ unacceptable”) and efficacy of the<br/>
product (three possible outcomes “good”, “average”, and “bad”) or<br/>
“abandon ” the project without further laboratory tests.</p>

<p><b>Decision</b> 2. According to the results of the laboratory tests, two possible<br/>
alternatives follows: “continue the project” doing “clinical trials” with<br/>
humans or “abandon” the project. The “clinical trials” can have two<br/>
possible results: Positive or Neutral. The results of clinical trials will be<br/>
available only after three years of testing.</p>

<p><b>Decision</b> 3. Whatever the results of the clinical trials, it will be necessary to<br/>
decide between: “launch the product” or “abandon” the project. After<br/>
launching the project, there can be two alternatives depending on the<br/>
economic viability: Success (S) with positive gains as a result of good<br/>
acceptance of the product in the market or, Failure (F) with little or no<br/>
acceptance of the product in the market. The launch of the product will<br/>
occur only in the fourth year of the project, after the laboratory tests (1<br/>
year) and clinical trials (3 years).</p>

<br><br/>
<br><br/>
<br><br/>


<p>290 Shimizu, de Carvalho and Laurindo</p>

<p>A decision tree with 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 24 branches other than the three alternatives<br/>
to “abandon” the project is then constructed.</p>

<p>The values of the costs in each node of the decision tree should also be<br/>
estimated. Since the nodes of the tree are located through different future time<br/>
periods during the project, each estimated value needs to be updated to the<br/>
present moment so that it will be possible to compare all these values in the initial<br/>
period of the project. The Net Present Value (NPV) method must be used for<br/>
this purpose.</p>

<b>Strategy A</b>
<p>Taking into account that the expert estimated the probability of launching the<br/>
product with success, as P (S) = 0,7, after exploring the decision tree from the<br/>
end to the beginning, this estimate provided, for example, an Expected<br/>
Monetary Value or EMV = $979 136 and the following possible events:</p>

<td align="center">$2,186,516</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p><b>Sensitivity Analysis</b></p>
<p>Up to this point, only one value for each cost and probability was estimated or<br/>
calculated to have a strategic decision alternative. An analysis of variation of the<br/>
results expressed in terms of EMV value, changing the values of the cost and/<br/>
or the probabilities is called Sensitivity Analysis of the project. In decision trees<br/>
of reduced size, this analysis is usually done by trying to answer the question,<br/>
“what would happen to the project result if this or that values were to occur?”<br/>
For example, let’s suppose that another strategy has been formulated.</p>
<p><b>Strategy B</b>
<p>If the expert suspects that after launching the product, the chances of success<br/>
or failure are equal, that is, P(Success) = P(Failure) = 0.5, redoing all the<br/>
calculations and utilizing the criterion of the greatest EMV value, we have a new<br/>
EMV value equals to $479,677 and the following events:<p>

<p>The new estimate P(Success) = 0.5 of the probability of success after launching<br/>
the product reduced the final value of EMV, creating a new possibility (d) for<br/>
abandoning the project.</p>
<p>In this case, a sensitivity analysis, based on the variation of the estimates of<br/>
probabilities and costs, is extremely time-consuming. Comparison of Strategy<br/>
A and B must be done using stochastic dominance technique based in Monte<br/>
Carlo calculations. The results of this analysis can be found in Gregory (1980).</p>

<div><h2>Conclusions</h2></div>
<div style="width:550px;height:4px;background-color:black;"></div>

<p>Complex strategic-decision problems often require the use of multistage<br/>
decision trees. For each event located at one of the tree nodes, an estimation<br/>
of the probability values corresponding to the level of uncertainty of occurrence<br/>
of this event is calculated. The estimations of these probability values based on<br/>
historical data or subjective assessment of experts are unlikely to be efficient<br/>
because of the large number of nodes and branches of the decision tree<br/>
involved. The chain of conditional probability values formed along a branch of<br/>
the decision tree may cause difficulty to conduct the decision based on a single<br/>
value of the Expected Monetary Value.</p>

<p>The simulation or Monte Carlo process generates a large number of random<br/>
results for the problem forming a statistically acceptable sample of the popu-<br/>
lation of events of the real problem. Simulation provides the determination of<br/>
the probability distribution of intermediate or final event of the decision process<br/>
making it possible the comparison of different strategies using the<i> stochastic<br/>
dominance</i> technique.</p>

<p>The decision-making process involving competition among companies can be<br/>
better understood and explained through the use of appropriate <i>business<br/>
games</i>. Business game is an efficient tool to create a virtual environment for<br/>
strategic competitions and can be used mainly for training purpose. Cost<br/>
restriction and the difficulty to find a business game tailored to the needs of a<br/>
company make its use more appropriate in university courses or in a specific<br/>
type of business.</p>
<p>Continuous system models of simulation are used to analyze the overall<br/>
dynamic behavior of a system represented by a set of continuous algebraic or<br/>
differential equations. Industrial Dynamics and Business Dynamics are used to<br/>
represent and analyze the dynamic transformation of industrial and business<br/>
activities over a period of time.</p>
<p>Simulation of real world problems involves many structured and nonstructured<br/>
parameters requiring the use of techniques of the Expert Systems and Artificial<br/>
Intelligence (Cook & Russel, 1993; Sanjay & others, 1990; Day et al., 1997).</p>

<p>Organizations are often seeking techniques for improving the actions to<br/>
structure decision models. However, with the possible exception of routine and<br/>
well-structured problems, most of the decision problems found in organizations<br/>
constitute a chaotic and complex family of problems. The<i> principle of bounded<br/>
rationality</i> proposed by Herbert Simon suggests the use of a decision model<br/>
based on a simplified model of a firm with a small number of relational concepts,<br/>
such as: (a) quasi resolution of conflict,( b) uncertainty avoidance or minimiza-<br/>
tion, (c) search directed around the main objective of the problem and, (d)<br/>
adaptation of organizational goals based on learning.</p>
